Ismaili Imam can change the Shariah

- So they follow no shariah today

The first historical abrogation

- Followed by the Ismaili imam converting to sunni islam

- Broken with wine

- Qiyamah overturned

The second historical abrogation

- The current era

- The dua was first in gujrati facing a picture of the imam

- then changed to arabic where sujood was done to the imam

So what really is obligatory in ismailism?

---

- islamic sources to negate all of this
