# A Disclaimer: Khalil Admits To Publicly Hiding His Beliefs

Khalil claims when he is presenting to Muslims and Non-Muslims alike that he is a practicing Muslim with a few different interpretations on issues relating to beliefs. This often misleads listeners to believe that what Khalil is presenting is an accurate, albeit slightly different, representation of Islam and that Khalil's work is a valid and globally accepted interpretation of the Islamic belief system based upon the Quran and the Sunnah.

What listeners do not realize, however, is that Khalil often employs the use of Taqiyyah, or the widely used Shia principle in which adherents are allowed and encouraged to hide their beliefs in virtually any situation that they seem fit. While practicing Taqiyyah, Shias are not only allowed to mask their beliefs from others but they are also permitted to blatantly lie to outsiders about the Shia beliefs as a whole, including the core tenets of Shi'ism. [^1]

The following clip is a confession from Khalil in which he explains how he hid away from his Muslim classmates during fasting hours in Ramadan and ate his snacks as everyone else continued the mandatory Islamic fasting. Khalil then claims that he was practicing Taqiyyah, a belief held by Shias in which they are allowed to hide their true beliefs in virtually any situation.

#### "We're in the middle of Ramadan, and I eat snacks every class, like thats just what I do..."

This should alarm readers for three reasons:

1. This should raise considerable concern for those listening to Khalil as a non-Ismaili. Khalil does not mention his true beliefs outside his closed-off religous group - these leaks being an evidence for the shocking things he has said when he assumed he was in a private space with his Ismaili listeners.

2. Khalil often complains about his beliefs not being accepted by others and yet himself expresses an inherent feeling of shame regarding their practice, to the point that he has to hide away from his Muslim colleauges to do so. Do keep in mind that Khalil was studying at Harvard at this time, a very safe place for Ismailis to practice and express their faith, with one of the lead professors on Islam at Harvard being an Ismaili [^2] and the Aga Khan holding a degree from there himself and delivering a lecture there in 2015. [^3] **How can something be the truth when even one of its main preachers is too ashamed to practice it in public?**

3. Khalil's statements outright contradict fundamental and agreed-upon Islamic principles. Reference the following:

> "O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous"<br><br> -- [Surah Al-Baqarah 2:183](https://quran.com/2/183)

With the above verse, the Holy Quran makes it clear that fasting was ordained compulsory on all Muslims and that they have to fast if they are to stay righteous.

> "...But to fast is best for you, if you only knew."<br><br> -- [Surah Al-Baqarah 2:184](https://quran.com/2/184)

> "The month of Ramadhan [is that] in which was revealed the Qur'an, a guidance for the people and clear proofs of guidance and criterion. So whoever sights [the new moon of] the month, let him fast it; and whoever is ill or on a journey - then an equal number of other days. Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship and [wants] for you to complete the period and to glorify Allah for that [to] which He has guided you; and perhaps you will be grateful."<br><br> -- [Surah Al-Baqarah 2:185](https://quran.com/2/185)

> The Messenger of Allah said: "Whoever breaks the fast during Ramadan without an allowance or illness, then if he fasted for all time, his fasting would not make up for it."<br><br> -- [Jami at-Tirmidhi](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi:723)

[^1]: It should be noted that Muslims are allowed to hide their beliefs in Sunni Islam as well, but only in dire situations like an immediate threat to one's life. However, blatantly lying about the true tenents of Islam to anyone is never permissible in Sunni Islam as that falls into misguiding others about the truth. This is a fundamental difference in Sunni and Shia interpretations and uses of Taqiyyah.
